# Mini Invoicer
A modern solution for a real-world collection of problems for small businesses that operate daily as physical products distributors. (confectionery, etc...)

## Perfect *use case*
You want to generate invoices or receipts to your customers where payments are not online but tracked anyway using the app (cash, cheques) and monitor your inventory.

### Side note: Graduate Project Initiative
Since I switched my major from mechanical engineering to computer science, always wondered what would my graduation project be...
Up until a dear friend of mine started a small business that distributes confectionery products to mini, small, supermarkets, retailers and wholesalers.
His business started invoicing customers manually, by that I mean, his employees wrote invoices and receipts on paper...
He asked me to build a custom solution for invoicing. Long story short, it was a one-man project and I couldn't deliver on time so he resorted to another software.
However, I kept the project at the back of my head then decided to continue building it as a graduation project that would make me proud.
Because of this, I learned immensely, how the internet works, a bit of gcp, web and mobile app building using amazing technologies created by google, sql, nosql,
system architecture, a sprinkle of project management, ui design,etc... and finally how to translate business *needs* to actual solutions using software engineering.
